# Pneumonia-Detection
A Pneumonia Detection Model is a deep learning-based system designed to automatically identify signs of pneumonia in chest X-ray or CT scan images. These models typically use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze and learn patterns associated with pneumonia, such as lung opacities and fluid accumulation.
Training involves feeding large datasets of labeled medical images (e.g., NIH or RSNA datasets) into the model, often with preprocessing steps like image normalization and augmentation to improve accuracy and robustness. Transfer learning is commonly employed by adapting pretrained models like ResNet or DenseNet to medical image classification tasks.

Once trained, the model takes a chest X-ray as input and outputs a prediction indicating the presence or absence of pneumonia. In more advanced versions, it may also localize the affected areas with bounding boxes or heatmaps. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC. These AI-driven tools aim to assist radiologists by providing quick, consistent, and accurate diagnoses, especially in areas with limited access to expert medical professionals.
