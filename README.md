# Pneumonia-Detection
A Pneumonia Detection Model is a deep learning-based system designed to automatically identify signs of pneumonia in chest X-ray or CT scan images. These models typically use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze and learn patterns associated with pneumonia, such as lung opacities and fluid accumulation.
